It is a gym app that you can sign up for. It uses Firebase for authentication and contains different roles, like online users and admins. It offers a system for users to follow the meal plan, workouts, payments, lessons, and body measurements given by a personal trainer, and it also has an admin dashboard, which is going to be used by trainers to provide these systems for their students.

<!-- Experience -->
## Experience
During the development, I learned about these: Firebase storage and admin rules to make our program more secure; dark-light mode using context and SASS variables; language support with the react-i18n library; how to handle multiple file imports with constraints; and how to use responsive mui data tables and react uuid to generate special ids for specific operations; and how to use index files to handle multiple file imports that make your component ugly.


### Built With
* React.js
* i18n
* SASS
* Vite
* React-router
* React icons-kit
* Framer Motion
